Investigates any trends in player performance after a mid-season trade

I used online stories to find all players traded near the MLB trade deadline from 2017 to 2019. Then I collected some relevant stats - wOBA and wRC+ for batters and FIP- and SIERA for pitchers - using fangraphs.com and compared the change in player performance to the change in the final winning percentages of the teams they were on that season.

There was no trend or statistical significance upon investigation.

wOBA R^2: 0.009
wRC+ R^2: 0.009
FIP- R^2: 0.037
SIERA R^2: 0.008
